# Dog Shelter Finder

Build an app that routes to different dogs and displays information on that dog when you're at that route.

- `/dogs` is the homepage and shows all three dogs
- Clicking on a dog takes you to that dog's route
  - clicking on Whiskey will take you to `/dogs/whiskey`
- `/` or `/something` and every other address not listed should navigate you to `/dogs`

Here's an image of what the app looks like
